DESCRIPTION
The goal of this project is to classify Iris flowers using a Decision Tree Model. The model is trained on the Iris dataset, which contains three species of flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset includes four features:

Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width
Steps Performed
Data Loading & Preprocessing

Loaded the Iris dataset using sklearn.datasets.load_iris().
Converted it into a Pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
Saved the dataset in CSV format.
Model Training

Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing.
Trained a Decision Tree Classifier using sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.
Used the Gini index as the criterion and limited tree depth to 3 to prevent overfitting.
Evaluation & Testing

Predicted labels for the test set.
Evaluated performance using Accuracy Score, Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix.
Visualization

Used sklearn.tree.plot_tree() to visualize the decision tree structure.
Saved the visualization as decision_tree.png.
Model Saving

Saved the trained model as decision_tree_model.pkl using joblib.dump().

üìä Results & Visualizations

Model Accuracy: Displays test accuracy and a classification report.
Confusion Matrix: Provides insights into prediction performance.
Decision Tree Visualization: The decision tree is saved as visualizations/decision_tree.png.

üåç Applications of Decision Tree Models

Medical Diagnosis: Used to classify diseases based on symptoms.
Spam Detection: Helps classify emails as spam or not.
Customer Segmentation: Used in marketing to group similar customers.
Fraud Detection: Identifies suspicious transactions in finance.
